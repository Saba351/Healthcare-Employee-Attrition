Healthcare Employee Attrition Analysis (SQL + Tableau)
# üìä Healthcare Employee Attrition Analysis (SQL + BigQuery)

This project explores employee attrition in a healthcare organization using SQL and Tableau. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and highlight high-risk groups that need HR attention.

## üîç Key Insights & Observations

### 1. Income Group vs Attrition
- ‚úÖ lower-income employees are leaving at a much higher rate. Attrition drops steadily as income increases.

### 2. Overtime vs Attrition
- ‚úÖ Employees working overtime have an attrition rate almost 6x higher than those who don‚Äôt.
-  This shows overtime is a major risk factor for employee burnout and resignation in healthcare.
-  Working overtime nearly triples the attrition risk.

### 3. Job Satisfaction vs Attrition
- There‚Äôs a clear negative correlation between job satisfaction and attrition rate.
- Employees with very low satisfaction (Level 1) have nearly double the attrition compared to those with high satisfaction (Level 4).
- This highlights the importance of employee engagement and morale in reducing turnover in the healthcare workforce.

### 4. Age Group vs Attrition
- ‚úÖ Younger employees are more likely to leave.

### 5. Overtime + Low Income Segment
- **Employees with Overtime & Monthly Income < 1000:** 63.7% attrition rate
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the highest-risk group and needs urgent HR focus.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations to Reduce Attrition

Based on the analysis, here are actionable suggestions to help reduce employee attrition in the healthcare sector:

- **Improve Compensation for Low-Income Employees:**  
  A large portion of attrition comes from employees earning less than 2000 per month. Offering competitive pay or bonuses may help retain this segment.

- **Address Overtime Burden:**  
  Employees working overtime ‚Äî especially those with low income ‚Äî show an attrition rate over 60%. Reviewing shift schedules and reducing excessive workloads is critical.

- **Enhance Job Satisfaction:**  
  Employees with the lowest job satisfaction scores are much more likely to leave. Conduct regular feedback sessions and improve working conditions, recognition programs, and career growth paths.

- **Focus on Younger Workforce:**  
  Employees under 30 have the highest attrition rate. Providing mentorship, training, and growth opportunities can help retain younger talent.

- **Target High-Risk Groups Proactively:**  
  Combine factors (e.g., overtime + low income) to identify and support employees most likely to leave before attrition happens.
